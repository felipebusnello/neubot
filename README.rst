``````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a lightweight open source software for network performance measurement. It was created and is managed within a research project on network neutrality by the NEXA Center for Internet & Society, at the Politecnico di Torino.

After downloaded and installed, the program runs in the background of the system, and periodically performs transmission tests with servers hosted by the distributed Measurement Lab platform. In the future, it will also perform peer-to-peer tests with other machines running the program.

Its transmission tests probe the Internet through various application-level protocols, and the results are saved both locally and on the test servers. As a consequence of the worldwide distribution of the network of machines running Neubot, the dataset compiled from the results gathered on the server contains samples from various Internet providers. As it is published on the web, anyone to analyze the data for research purposes.
