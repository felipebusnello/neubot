Neubot, the network neutrality bot
``````````````````````````````````

Neubot <http://neubot.org> is a lightweight free and open source
software for network performance and network neutrality measurement.
It was created and is now developed and maintained by the NEXA Center
for Internet & Society, Dept. of Control and Computer Engineering,
Politecnico di Torino <http://nexa.polito.it>. Once downloaded
and installed, the program runs in the background of the system
and periodically performs transmission tests with instances of
itself, installed on servers provided by Measurement Lab (M-Lab)
<http://measurementlab.net/>, which is a distributed server
platform that provides hosting and other services to Neubot and
similar projects.

Neubot transmission tests measure end-to-end network performances
through various application-level protocols (currently HTTP and
BitTorrent), and test results are saved both locally and on M-Lab
servers. In turn, results saved on M-Lab servers are periodically
harvested and published on M-Lab website under the terms and conditions
of Creative Commons Zero license, allowing anyone to analyze them
for research purposes <http://measurementlab.net/data>.

The published dataset contains samples from portions of the network
where Neubot is installed.  And, theorically, given enough Neubots
installed worldwide, it should be possible to map significant subset
of the Internet.  As such, the success of the project relies on the
quantity and distribution of its users.

Neubot collects the user's Internet address along with the results,
which is personal data according to European law.  Therefore,
users must provide their informed consent to collect and publish
their Internet addresses, otherwise the program cannot run any test.
