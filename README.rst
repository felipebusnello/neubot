Neubot, the network neutrality bot
``````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a lightweight free and open source software for network performance measurement, monitors and quantifies network neutrality. It was created and is now developed and maintained by the NEXA Center for Internet & Society within the context of the project on network neutrality of the same name.

After downloaded and installed, the program runs in the background of the system, and periodically performs transmission tests with servers hosted by the distributed Measurement Lab platform. In the future, it will also perform peer-to-peer tests with other machines running the program. Its transmission tests probe the Internet through various application-level protocols (currently HTTP and BitTorrent), and the results are saved both locally and on the test servers, and published on the web under a CC-0 licence, allowing anyone to analyze the data for research purposes. As a consequence of the worldwide distribution of the network of machines running Neubot, the dataset compiled from the results gathered on the server contains samples from various Internet providers. As such, the success of the project relies on the quantity and distribution of its users.
